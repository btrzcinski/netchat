Using the 'help' command once inside the Py-Client provides a list of all
active command plugins. 'help plugin' will give a detailed list of each
command associated with a plugin, along with their respective doc strings.

Sample commands:

friend [name]: 		Adds [name] to the friends list
unfriend [name]: 	Removes [name] from the friends list
block [name]: 		Blocks communication from [name]
unblock [name]: 	Unblocks communication from [name]
fl:			Shows the friends list. Online friends are
			  prefixed with a (*)
sf [name] [path]:	Attempts to send a file at [path] to [name]
gc [room]:		Connects to a groupchat session at [room]
help:			Displays command-related information
quit:			Exits the program

Prefixing input with a slash (/) in a chat window will intepret the
input as a command.
